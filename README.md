# odin-cv-project-hook

## What is this about?

This toy project is a reinforcement to React hooks and compositional components as the step up after [Odin-cv-project-class-component](https://github.com/Trantuvan/odin-cv-project)
The design of the project is to showcase the understanding of concepts below:

- useState
- useContext
- useReducer
- CSS modules

The aim of this app is to build your simple and minimalist resume!

#### Note

- This project will not support for responsive but [Odin-cv-project-class-component](https://github.com/Trantuvan/odin-cv-project) does.
- For this small project useState is enough (no need for `useContext` & `useReducer`)
- Compositional components and lifting state up are the goto techniques for most apps state management
